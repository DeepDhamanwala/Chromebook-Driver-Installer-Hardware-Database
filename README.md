# One-Click Chromebook Driver Installer

A Rust-based automated driver installation system designed for Chromebooks running Linux. This tool simplifies the post-installation process by automatically detecting hardware and fetching the correct drivers.

## 🚀 Features

* **Automated Hardware Detection:** Identifies device model and chipset (e.g., Kaby Lake, Skylake) via a local JSON database.
* **Structured Database:** Maps over 200+ Chromebook models to their specific driver requirements.
* **Dynamic Updates:** Capable of fetching the latest driver metadata at runtime without rebuilding the application.
* **High Performance:** Built with Rust for memory safety and speed.

## 🛠️ Usage
1. "Help" Command 
Command:
Bash
cargo run -- --help
displays the automatic help menu generated by the Rust clap library, showing the version, author, and available commands.

2. List Supported Models
Command:
Bash

cargo run -- list-models

Reads the hardware_db.json file.

Prints a formatted table of all Chromebooks your tool supports (Pixelbook, ASUS C302, etc.).

3. Install Driver
This simulates the actual installation process.
Command:
Bash

cargo run -- install --model google_pixelbook
It looks up the "Google Pixelbook" in your JSON file.

Finds the specific drivers (e.g., kb_backlight, touchpad_elan).

Runs the installation simulation with the loading bars/delays.

4. Update Database
Use this to demonstrate the "Dynamic Update" feature.
Command
Bash

cargo run -- update-db

Simulates connecting to a server.

"Downloads" the latest JSON metadata (in this demo, it simulates the network wait time).

Tells the user the database is up to date.

### Prerequisites
* Rust (Cargo) installed on the host machine.
